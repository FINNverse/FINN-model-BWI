## FINN-bwi | scripts/148_prepare_two_interval_v12_no_year0.R
##
## two-interval-v12 = two-interval-v8 without env row `year 0`. Nothing else
## changes.
##
## WHY    Every two-interval version (v1-v11) lays the annual env grid out as
##        year = 0:10 (calendar t0..t0+10; scripts/131:421-427) with the census
##        at obs year 10. Year 0 was meant as the initial state, but FINN has no
##        initial-state env row: the initial state is init_cohort_dt, and every
##        env row drives one annual transition. fit() maps obs year 10 to step
##        11 (year_sequence from the factor levels 0..10, FINN
##        R/finn-class.R:1894), and each step applies growth, mortality and
##        regeneration before the stand is aggregated (:946-1197). So the
##        scored dbh / ba / trees were the state after 11 transitions for a
##        10-year interval, the first driven by the t0 climate. The rate
##        windows (growth, mortality, recruitment) were already the correct 10
##        steps, calendar t0+1..t0+10. Verified with a synthetic run (a
##        certain-death pulse in env row 10 kills the stand at step 11, not 10).
##
## FIX    env_dt and env_unscaled_dt keep only years 1..10 (calendar
##        t0+1..t0+10). obs_dt / tree_obs_dt stay at year 10 with
##        period_length 10, so year_sequence = 10: the scored state is 10
##        transitions after the start census, and the rate window is steps
##        1..10 = the same calendar years as in v8. Calendar year of simulated
##        year k is now t0 + k (v8: t0 + k - 1); scripts reading v12 use
##        sim_year = obs_year, not obs_year + 1.
##
## SCALING (decision of this script)
##        env_scales.csv is v8's, unchanged, and the kept env values are v8's
##        values byte for byte. Recomputing the pooled mean / sd over years
##        1..10 would move every scaled value slightly and mix a second change
##        into the version; with v8's scales the only difference between v8 and
##        v12 is the dropped row, which is what the fix is.
